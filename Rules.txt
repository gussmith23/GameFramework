Rules for RuleBook:

0. varnames are alphanumeric and underscores
1. Name of the state begins a paragraph and ends with ':' (no space)
2. Paragraphs are made up of statements, each of which end with '.'
3. One paragraph represents a state; the whole game is multiple states (paragraphs)
4. Strings are surrounded by ""
5. If/Else if/Else structures are possible and defined by:
	a. the last statements in each block end with '.'
	b. intermediate statements in each block end with ','
	c. conditionals end with ':'
6. Final states (for example clear winning or losing) end with "Finish." statement
7. Exact Python code can be written when surrounded with backticks ``
8. Comments are surrounded by ()
9. Mandatory paragraph: "init"
	a. Initialization of variables takes place in init (for us)

Future Rules (?):
10. If floats are used, there can be no whitespace in the middle (e.g. "1 . 0" is not valid, versus "1.0")
11. Input types:
	a. Get <> as number
	b. Get <> as string
12. String formatting: "This is a number {varname} !"
